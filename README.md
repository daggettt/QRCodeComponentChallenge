## My process

  ### Built with

  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox


  ### Continued development

  I'd like to strengthen my understanding of CSS workflow - especially when working with flexbox. Hoping to make this process feel a little more intuitive. Also, need to work more with responsive design. 

  ### Useful resources

  - [W3Schools: CSS Layout Horizontal & Vertical Align](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp) - This helped me with centering items (vertically and horizontally).
